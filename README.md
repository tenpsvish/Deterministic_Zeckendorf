# Deterministic_Zeckendorf
In 2020, Li et al. (arxiv:2006.16457) introduced 16 deterministic Zeckendorf games, where there is a fixed (preference) order of which available move each player takes: combine largest (cl), split largest (sl), combine smallest (cs), split smallest (ss). I set up a simulation for all 16 of these games, thereby a computational means to study them.
