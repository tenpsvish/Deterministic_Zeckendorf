# Deterministic_Zeckendorf
In 2020, Li et al. (arxiv:2006.16457) introduced 16 deterministic Zeckendorf games, where there is a fixed (preference) order of which available move each player takes: combine largest (cl), split largest (sl), combine smallest (cs), split smallest (ss). I set up a simulation for all 16 of these games, thereby a computational means to study them.

Install all necessary libraries (namely numpy and pandas) on your machine. Then, compile main.py - you will be prompted to choose how many games (maximum N) and which of the 16 deterministic variants you would like to simulate. The simulation data will be written to a CSV file called "output.csv" in the project directory.
